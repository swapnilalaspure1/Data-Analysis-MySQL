# Pizza Sales, Data-Analysis-Excel, MySQL & PowerBI

DataSet:- I have downloaded the "Pizza Sales" data set from Kaggle.
Then, I used Popular tools like MySQL WorkeBench, PowerBI (Visualisation) and Excel for Data Analysis in this project.

# Excel 
I have used Excel for basic data cleaning, removing null values and date and time formatting.

# Functions I Used
After Loading data into MySQL, I generated some insights from the data using the simple following function:
1) Count()
2) Sum()
3) Distinct()
4) DAYNAME()
5) MONTHNAME()
6) Group By()
7) Order By()
8) Round()
9) DESC
10) Limit()

Insight generated from MySQL Query I used them to compare with the PowerBI generated insights.

# PowerBI
In PowerBI, 
I used PowerQuery and DAX Query to prepare and transform my data,
Extracted Day and Month names, from Date Column in the Power Query, also created some new measures like "Total Revenue", "Total Orders", "Total Quantity" etc.
using Dax Query.
